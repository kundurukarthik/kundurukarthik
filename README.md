# 💫 About Me

Hi, I am **Karthik Venkata Sai Reddy Kunduru**. I am an **MS Computer Science** student at **Arizona State University** (expected **Aug 2027**). I build **reliable full stack and backend systems** where clean APIs, strong data flows, and smooth UX come together.

### What I do
- **Full stack engineering:** Angular UI, ASP.NET Core APIs, real-time features, and SQL systems that scale cleanly  
- **Backend development:** Spring Boot services using JPA and Hibernate with validation, testing, and maintainable architecture  
- **Data and analytics:** Python and SQL pipelines, dashboards, forecasting, and automation that reduce manual work

### Proof I ship
- Shipped production features at **Infosys** as a **Full Stack Developer Intern and Scrum Master**  
  - Built Angular components and ASP.NET Core APIs  
  - Tuned SQL Server to cut average API latency from **~400 ms to ~300 ms**
- Built backend services at **Digital Trust Technologies** using **Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate**, plus testing and validation
- Built **Python + SQL pipelines** and analytics dashboards that reduced manual analysis effort by **~50 percent**
- Built an **AI powered task management dashboard** using **Angular, .NET Core, SignalR, Azure OpenAI**
- Published a computer vision project on traffic sign recognition in **IEEE Xplore**

### 🎤 I’m currently working on
- Upgrading my portfolio repos with clean READMEs, demos, and reproducible setup
- Building more full stack features with Angular, .NET Core, and SQL plus strong authentication patterns
- Practicing system design fundamentals and interview problem solving in Python and Java

### 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Full stack apps (Angular or React) with backend APIs in .NET Core, Spring Boot, or FastAPI
- Backend projects: microservices, database design, API performance, reliability
- Practical AI features: workflow automation, LLM powered tools, dashboards

### 🧠 I’m looking for help with
- Architecture and code reviews, testing strategy, and maintainability feedback
- Open source contribution direction and picking high impact issues
- CI/CD improvements using Docker and GitHub Actions

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Scalable API patterns, service boundaries, and better system design habits
- Cloud deployment best practices on Azure and AWS
- Data engineering foundations: performance tuning, pipelines, and observability

### 💬 Ask me about
- Angular, .NET Core, Spring Boot, FastAPI, REST API design
- SQL Server optimization and query performance
- Real-time systems using SignalR and event driven workflows
- Azure OpenAI integrations for product features
- Computer vision and my IEEE Xplore publication

### ⚡ Fun fact
I love taking projects from idea to shipped result, then documenting it like a real product build.
